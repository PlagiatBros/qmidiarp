	* mainwindow.cpp, midiarp.cpp, seqdriver.cpp, passwidget.cpp: 
	MIDI controller for muting arps implemented. The controller for the
	first arp can be configured in the settings tab, the other arps in 
	row are the following CC numbers. When the corresponding CC with
	value 127 is received, the arp mute state is toggled.
	* qmidiarp_*.ts: translations updated, obsoletes left atm

2009-09-03 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>

	* seqdriver.cpp: fixed FootSwitch event that still got copied to unmatched
	* passwidget.cpp: port numbers really starting at 1 now

	starting from 1 instead of 0

2009-08-22 Guido Scholz <guido.scholz@bayernline.de>
	* arpdata.cpp arpscreen.* gui.* midiarp.* seqdriver.*: Some
	cleanups, improved string parameter handling
	* arpwidget.cpp: Adjust size of Input/Output boxes

2009-08-16 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* qmidiarp_fr.ts: French translation added

2009-08-16 Guido Scholz <guido.scholz@bayernline.de>
	* arpwidget.cpp: Keyboard shortcuts added for some widgets,
	fixed layout bug, texts made translatable
	* arpscreen.cpp: Obsolete pen.setColor() calls removed, unused C
	header files removed.

2009-08-15 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* arpscreen.cpp: fixed fall through in switch and unfinished "."
	interpretation, removed resizeEvent(), set font at beginning of
	the drawEvent routine
	* gui.cpp, seqdriver.cpp: fixed queue start issue when no arp is
	present, the queue is now off on program startup and has to be
	enabled manually after addArp or load
	* passwidget.cpp: fixed yet another logic problem with enabling
	MIDI clock
	* seqdriver.cpp: take into account MIDI clock for ArpScreen
	follower line
	
2009-08-13 Guido Scholz <guido.scholz@bayernline.de>
	* package: cleanups, use .qmidiarprc instead of .qmarc
	
2009-08-13 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* package: use xpm icons instead, which are part of sources now and
	EXTRA_DIST
	
2009-08-08 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* package: optimized layout, removed unnecessary QWidgets (gscholz)
	* package: icons are now installed properly in 
	PREFIX/share/qmidiarp/pixmaps by using 
	a gcc ... -D option as defined in icons/Makefile.am
	* 
	* arpwidget.cpp, gui.cpp: pattern preset structure is now saved 
	in a .qmarc file created in the user's home if non-existent.
	* arpwidget.cpp: added 'removePattern' Toolbutton
	* arpwidget.cpp, midiarp.cpp: the mute button is now working by 
	setting all note velocities = 0 when checked
	* gui.h, main.cpp: use PACKAGE for version reporting

2009-08-02 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* seqdriver.cpp, arpscreen.cpp: a follower line now indicates the 
	queue position in the arpscreen pattern. The position is derived 
	from the current tick and the pattern length and unaware of the actual 
	output notes. Therefore the queue is restarted at every pattern change.
	* arpwidget.cpp: a pattern preset structure is now in place in form 
	of a combobox. Pattern presets can be edited and stored to memory 
	(no diskwrite yet), pattern text is now hidden by default and 
	appears upon click of the new 'edit pattern' button
	* arpwidget.cpp: further GUI refactoring: 
	qtoolbuttons/actions replace the qpushbuttons, added icons,
	created a toolbar holding the main buttons and tempo spinner,
	todo: install icons in PREFIX/share/qmidiarp,
	added a mute checkbox (non-functional yet),
	random settings are now hidden by default and appear upon press 
	of a toolbutton, inserted various stretches to eliminate fixed width 
	labels, shamefully added arpscreen to the pattern groupbox

2009-07-15 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* seqdriver.cpp: added support for damper footswitch to hold and buffer 
	incoming notes
	* seqdriver.cpp: queue start is now back working
	* gui.cpp: queue start button is grayed when midi clock use checked
		 
2009-07-12 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* package: added autotools build environment, moved sources to the
	src subdirectory, updated COPYING file and added two sentences to
	the README, updated INSTALL file
	Remaining issues: 
	   Tempo needs to be the same as that of the midi clock master
	   Queue is not automatically started
	   Queue start button should be grayed when receiving MIDI clock start

2009-02-07 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* package: added a graphical representation of the pattern text
	that is updated on every text change, included port counter in out
	port names and renamed in port to "QMidiARP in", initial MIDI
	real time clock start and stop support:
	  When MIDI clock is being checked, the queue is stopped and
	  started upon reception MIDI_START
	Known issue: the queue is not started automatically. You need to
	un/recheck 'start queue'
	MIDI ticks per beat and MIDI Clock Mode can be selected from the
	passWidget
	Added a switchable filter for MIDI Clock events to the logWidget.
	The logtext is now color
	minor UI tweaks:
	   Tempo Spinner and Queue Start Button now in the top row of the
	   GUI, visible all the time
	   Fixed maximum size of the groove and pass widgets 

2009-06-25 Frank Kober <goemusic@yahoo.fr>
	* package: corrected disable/enable behaviour of rename button,
	addArp and renameArp do now respect 'cancel' in name dialog
	corrected: renaming of all tabs including the three 'system' tabs
	was permitted
