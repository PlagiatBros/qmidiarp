	* package: added a graphical representation of the pattern text
	that is updated on every text change, included port counter in out
	port names and renamed in port to "QMidiARP in", initial MIDI
	real time clock start and stop support:
	  When MIDI clock is being checked, the queue is stopped and
	  started upon reception MIDI_START

	un/recheck 'start queue'
	MIDI ticks per beat and MIDI Clock Mode can be selected from the
	passWidget
	Added a switchable filter for MIDI Clock events to the logWidget.
	The logtext is now color
	minor UI tweaks:
	   Tempo Spinner and Queue Start Button now in the top row of the
	   GUI, visible all the time
	   Fixed maximum size of the groove and pass widgets
