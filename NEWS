qmidiarp-0.5.0 (2012-03-24)

New Features
  o New global storage handler allows storing and switching of parameters
    and patterns between different storage locations. The restore switch
    can be triggered after a specified module reaches its pattern end or
    after a full number of beats. Switch can be done for a specific
    module only or for all modules globally.
  o Storage switches can be done by MIDI controller. The controller value
    specifies the storage location.
  o A new Legato option permits module triggering also by notes played
    legato.

Fixed Bugs
  o ALSA backend had become unstable in version 0.4.4 by some direct
    function calls across threads.
  o LFO waveform display didn't get updated during recording
  o LFO recording caused restarting/triggering when it shouldn't
  o Seq cloning led to crashes under certain conditions


qmidiarp-0.4.5 (2012-01-21)

Fixed Bugs
  o JACK Transport start with ALSA backend was broken in 0.4.4
  o Event forwarding port index was uninitialized in JACK MIDI backend


qmidiarp-0.4.4 (2011-12-24)

New Features
  o JACK MIDI backend doesn't require Jack Transport anymore

Improvements
  o Better usability of the sequencer loop marker
  o Improved LFO offset slider behavior
  o Quantization to the minimum stepwidth in Arp modules active when
    changes in Arp patterns occur

Fixed Bugs
  o Crash on startup in JACK MIDI mode on certain systems
  o When cloning modules, the current play direction wasn't copied
  o Unmatched MIDI event forwarding didn't work with Arp modules
  o Typo in english manpage


qmidiarp-0.4.3 (2011-11-20)

New Features
  o Groove functions now work for all modules, not only Arps
  o Effect of groove settings is displayed in the Arp/LFO/Seq screen
  o LFOs can be triggered and restarted by the keyboard
  o When reducing the size of LFO waves or Sequences, the original data
    is kept in memory and is also saved to the session file as a whole
  o LFO and Seq play direction can now be chosen, and bouncing loops are
    possible
  o New user positionable loop marker in Seq module. The marker is
    placed by left or right mouse click on the bottom cursor line of the
    sequencer and represents an additional return/loop point. It can be
    removed again by clicking in the bottom left or right area of the
    Seq screen.
  o Triggered one-shot play of LFO and Seqs improved
  o JACK MIDI backend available. This is now default, use the -a option
    for getting the ALSA backend
  o JACK Session support when using JACK MIDI backend

Fixed Bugs
  o A rounding error led to desync when Arps were used with groove shift
  o MIDI controls for Groove did not initialize upon "New..."
  o MIDI Controllers assigned to multiple destinations stopped at the
    first one encountered and ignored all others

General Changes
  o JACK MIDI is now the default backend, -a option enables ALSA backend
  o Obsolete .qma text file import removed


qmidiarp-0.4.2 (2011-07-10)

New Features
  o LFO wave lengths up to 32 bars for very low frequencies
  o Groove Settings and LFO & Seq resolutions now also MIDI-controllable
  o One-click duplication of LFO and Seq modules
  o Option to add new modules in muted state
  o Vertical Zoom switch for Seq module display
  o ToolBars can be positioned vertically
  o Nested arrangement of modules allows more flexible layouts

Fixed Bugs
  o 0.4.1-patch had been available for the following two:
    o Jack Transport sync arbitrarily stopping with only arp modules
    o Instability with ALSA clock with only Seq and LFO modules
  o Faster response to Jack Transport state changes
  o Incorrect response to two Seq sliders

General Changes
  o Jack Transport sync uses jack process callback not sync callback


qmidiarp-0.4.1 (2011-05-29)

New Features
  o All modules now have a playhead cursor
  o LFOs can record controller data by a MIDI-learnable Record button.
  o Seq modules handle note events at the input for triggering
  o Spanish translation thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas (plcl)
  o Czech translation thanks to Pavel Fric
  o Functional doxygen documentation available by "make doxygen-doc"
  o New SVG icon and desktop file


qmidiarp-0.3.9 (2011-01-05)

New Features
  o Arpeggio pattern preset infrastructure
  o Synchronized MIDI LFO modules added
    LFOs have calculated and drawable waveforms, selectable frequency,
    amplitude, offset, time resolution and length
  o Synchronized step sequencer modules added
    Step sequencer can be transposed and velocity-modulated by received
    notes, sequence can be drawn on the fly
  o Pianoroll-type display of arp patterns and cursor line
  o Envelope function for chord arpeggios with high polyphony
  o Latch mode or Footswitch for holding notes in arpeggio buffer
  o Keyboard-triggered or -restarted arpeggiator mode
  o Input note delay strongly reduced making QMidiArp suitable for live
    play
  o MIDI-learnable control of many live-relevant functions
  o MIDI realtime clock slave synchronization
  o JACK transport client synchronization
  o Event log entries are color-coded, optional MIDI Clock event display
  o Re-designed graphical user interface:  all modules and dialogs
    are dockable floatable windows, main and file icon toolbars added
  o New .qmidiarprc file containing GUI settings, user arp patterns and
    last file path
  o Save and SaveAs functions with modification monitoring
  o All relevant session parameters stored in new .qmax XML session file
  o Manual pages in English, French and German
  o Handler for SIGINT added to handle unsaved or changed files more
    carefully at program termination.
  o Handler for SIGUSR1 added to provide support for LADISH level 1.
  o Separate threads for ALSA Sequencer Queue handler and arpeggio engine


General Changes
  o Port form Qt3 to Qt4 library.
  o MIDI Channels and ALSA port id's displayed from 1...16
  o On-the-fly tempo changes are disabled
