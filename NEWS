qmidiarp-0.4.3 (2011-11-??)

New Features
  o Groove functions now work for all modules, not only Arps
  o Effect of groove settings is displayed in the Arp/LFO/Seq screen
  o LFOs can be triggered and restarted by the keyboard
  o When reducing the size of LFO waves or Sequences, the original data
    is kept in memory and is also saved to the session file as a whole
  o LFO and Seq play direction can now be chosen, and bouncing loops are
    possible
  o Triggered one-shot play of LFO and Seqs improved
  o JACK MIDI backend available. This is now default, use the -a option
    for getting the ALSA backend
  o JACK Session support when using JACK MIDI backend

Fixed Bugs
  o A rounding error led to desync when Arps were used with groove shift
  o MIDI controls for Groove did not initialize upon "New..."
  o MIDI Controllers assigned to multiple destinations stopped at the
    first one encountered and ignored all others

General Changes
  o JACK MIDI is now the default backend, -a option enables ALSA backend
  o Obsolete .qma text file import removed


qmidiarp-0.4.2 (2011-07-10)

New Features
  o LFO wave lengths up to 32 bars for very low frequencies
  o Groove Settings and LFO & Seq resolutions now also MIDI-controllable
  o One-click duplication of LFO and Seq modules
  o Option to add new modules in muted state
  o Vertical Zoom switch for Seq module display
  o ToolBars can be positioned vertically
  o Nested arrangement of modules allows more flexible layouts

Fixed Bugs
  o 0.4.1-patch had been available for the following two:
    o Jack Transport sync arbitrarily stopping with only arp modules
    o Instability with ALSA clock with only Seq and LFO modules
  o Faster response to Jack Transport state changes
  o Incorrect response to two Seq sliders

General Changes
  o Jack Transport sync uses jack process callback not sync callback


qmidiarp-0.4.1 (2011-05-29)

New Features
  o All modules now have a playhead cursor
  o LFOs can record controller data by a MIDI-learnable Record button.
  o Seq modules handle note events at the input for triggering
  o Spanish translation thanks to Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas (plcl)
  o Czech translation thanks to Pavel Fric
  o Functional doxygen documentation available by "make doxygen-doc"
  o New SVG icon and desktop file


qmidiarp-0.3.9 (2011-01-05)

New Features
  o Arpeggio pattern preset infrastructure
  o Synchronized MIDI LFO modules added
    LFOs have calculated and drawable waveforms, selectable frequency,
    amplitude, offset, time resolution and length
  o Synchronized step sequencer modules added
    Step sequencer can be transposed and velocity-modulated by received
    notes, sequence can be drawn on the fly
  o Pianoroll-type display of arp patterns and cursor line
  o Envelope function for chord arpeggios with high polyphony
  o Latch mode or Footswitch for holding notes in arpeggio buffer
  o Keyboard-triggered or -restarted arpeggiator mode
  o Input note delay strongly reduced making QMidiArp suitable for live
    play
  o MIDI-learnable control of many live-relevant functions
  o MIDI realtime clock slave synchronization
  o JACK transport client synchronization
  o Event log entries are color-coded, optional MIDI Clock event display
  o Re-designed graphical user interface:  all modules and dialogs
    are dockable floatable windows, main and file icon toolbars added
  o New .qmidiarprc file containing GUI settings, user arp patterns and
    last file path
  o Save and SaveAs functions with modification monitoring
  o All relevant session parameters stored in new .qmax XML session file
  o Manual pages in English, French and German
  o Handler for SIGINT added to handle unsaved or changed files more
    carefully at program termination.
  o Handler for SIGUSR1 added to provide support for LADISH level 1.
  o Separate threads for ALSA Sequencer Queue handler and arpeggio engine


General Changes
  o Port form Qt3 to Qt4 library.
  o MIDI Channels and ALSA port id's displayed from 1...16
  o On-the-fly tempo changes are disabled
