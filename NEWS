qmidiarp-0.5.3 (2013-11-??)

New Features
  o Random functions for sequencer and LFO steps and arp repeat mode
    (feature request #5 Keith Milner)

Improvements
  o NSM support now handles import/export/clear to facilitate
    getting started (Roy Vegard Ovesen)
  o Tempo is now MIDI-controllable (MIDI-learn)
  o Seqeuncer transpose slider is now MIDI controllable (MIDI-learn)
    (feature request #7)
  o Seqeuncer pattern maximum length extended to 32 bars
    (feature request #6)

Fixed Bugs
  o LFO offset jumped back to fixed value when MIDI controlled
    (bug #6 distrozapper)
  o Arp trigger behavior was not practical with chords pressed on keyboard
    (bug #7 Burkhard Ritter)
  o JACK Transport no longer worked when no JT Master was present
    (bug #5 Barney Holmes)
  o Deleting an arp pattern in text window while running caused crash
  o Note lengths were not consistent between alsa and jack backends
  o Note lengths did not account for current tempo.
  o Seq note length is now a 16th at half slider scale


qmidiarp-0.5.2 (2013-05-09)

New Features
  o Tempo changes are again possible while running, both manually or by
    a Jack Transport Master
  o Jack Transport position is now taken into account when starting,
    QMidiArp used to start always at zero
  o Muting and sequencer parameter changes can be deferred to pattern
    end using a new toolbutton
  o Modules in the Global Storage window have mute/defer buttons
  o Global Storage location switches can be set to affect only the pattern
  o Non Session Manager support with "switch" capability (thanks to
    Roy Vegard Ovesen)

General Changes
  o NSM support requires liblo development headers (liblo-dev package)


qmidiarp-0.5.1 (2012-11-17)

New Features
  o Global Storages have new features accessible through right-click
    on each storage location. You can choose if at pattern end another
    storage location is automatically selected and create dynamic pattern
    sequences.
  o Global Storage now has a position pacman indicator for each module
  o Clicking on the top button in the global store window now raises the
    selected module window
  o When Jack is not available at program start, show a message window
  o Introduce semitone shifts in Arp patterns (request 3574549 by gionnico)
  o Allow repetition of the 0 note within chords to stack notes when only
    a single note is played on the keyboard (request 3574549 by gionnico)
  o The module input-output panels on the left can now be hidden, this
    leaves some more space when running several modules side-by-side

Fixed Bugs
  o When starting from scratch, qmidiarp sometimes didn't start with
    internal clock
  o When editing an arp pattern while running, qmidiarp crashed when the
    pattern length reached zero
  o Deleting the last module sometimes crashed qmidiarp
  o Trigger mode sometimes caused hanging when a new note was received
  o Global Storage locations did not get updated when module names changed

General Changes
  o There have been many changes toward realtime compatibility under the
    hood. In particular, there are no more memory allocations/frees in
    the realtime component.
  o LFO Waveforms with high resolutions and lengths appear with finer
    streaks
  o The Mute state of each module is no longer changed when a parameter
    restore is done
  o Overall CPU usage should be slightly reduced


qmidiarp-0.5.0 (2012-03-24)

New Features
  o New global storage handler allows storing and switching of parameters
    and patterns between different storage locations. The restore switch
    can be triggered after a specified module reaches its pattern end or
    after a full number of beats. Switch can be done for a specific
    module only or for all modules globally.
  o Storage switches can be done by MIDI controller. The controller value
    specifies the storage location.
  o A new Legato option permits module triggering also by notes played
    legato.

Fixed Bugs
  o ALSA backend had become unstable in version 0.4.4 by some direct
    function calls across threads.
  o LFO waveform display didn't get updated during recording
  o LFO recording caused restarting/triggering when it shouldn't
  o Seq cloning led to crashes under certain conditions


qmidiarp-0.4.5 (2012-01-21)

Fixed Bugs
  o JACK Transport start with ALSA backend was broken in 0.4.4
  o Event forwarding port index was uninitialized in JACK MIDI backend


qmidiarp-0.4.4 (2011-12-24)

New Features
  o JACK MIDI backend doesn't require Jack Transport anymore

Improvements
  o Better usability of the sequencer loop marker
  o Improved LFO offset slider behavior
  o Quantization to the minimum stepwidth in Arp modules active when
    changes in Arp patterns occur

Fixed Bugs
  o Crash on startup in JACK MIDI mode on certain systems
  o When cloning modules, the current play direction wasn't copied
  o Unmatched MIDI event forwarding didn't work with Arp modules
  o Typo in english manpage


qmidiarp-0.4.3 (2011-11-20)

New Features
  o Groove functions now work for all modules, not only Arps
  o Effect of groove settings is displayed in the Arp/LFO/Seq screen
  o LFOs can be triggered and restarted by the keyboard
  o When reducing the size of LFO waves or Sequences, the original data
    is kept in memory and is also saved to the session file as a whole
  o LFO and Seq play direction can now be chosen, and bouncing loops are
    possible
  o New user positionable loop marker in Seq module. The marker is
    placed by left or right mouse click on the bottom cursor line of the
    sequencer and represents an additional return/loop point. It can be
    removed again by clicking in the bottom left or right area of the
    Seq screen.
  o Triggered one-shot play of LFO and Seqs improved
  o JACK MIDI backend available. This is now default, use the -a option
    for getting the ALSA backend
  o JACK Session support when using JACK MIDI backend

Fixed Bugs
  o A rounding error led to desync when Arps were used with groove shift
  o MIDI controls for Groove did not initialize upon "New..."
  o MIDI Controllers assigned to multiple destinations stopped at the
    first one encountered and ignored all others

General Changes
  o JACK MIDI is now the default backend, -a option enables ALSA backend
  o Obsolete .qma text file import removed


qmidiarp-0.4.2 (2011-07-10)

New Features
  o LFO wave lengths up to 32 bars for very low frequencies
  o Groove Settings and LFO & Seq resolutions now also MIDI-controllable
  o One-click duplication of LFO and Seq modules
  o Option to add new modules in muted state
  o Vertical Zoom switch for Seq module display
  o ToolBars can be positioned vertically
  o Nested arrangement of modules allows more flexible layouts

Fixed Bugs
  o 0.4.1-patch had been available for the following two:
    o Jack Transport sync arbitrarily stopping with only arp modules
    o Instability with ALSA clock with only Seq and LFO modules
  o Faster response to Jack Transport state changes
  o Incorrect response to two Seq sliders

General Changes
  o Jack Transport sync uses jack process callback not sync callback


qmidiarp-0.4.1 (2011-05-29)

New Features
  o All modules now have a playhead cursor
  o LFOs can record controller data by a MIDI-learnable Record button.
